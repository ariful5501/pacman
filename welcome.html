      <li><strong>Objective:</strong> The objective of the game is to control the Pacman character and eat all the food dots while avoiding the ghosts.</li>
      <li><strong>Controls:</strong> Use the arrow keys (left, up, right, down) on the keyboard to control the movement of Pacman.</li>
      <li><strong>Pacman:</strong> Pacman is represented by a yellow circle. It moves through the maze and eats food dots. The direction changes based on the keys pressed by the player.</li>
      <li><strong>Ghosts:</strong> Ghosts are represented by colored rectangles. They move randomly through the maze and try to collide with Pacman. If Pacman collides with a ghost, <br>the player loses a life.</li>
      <li><strong>Walls:</strong> The maze contains walls represented by blue rectangles. Pacman cannot move through walls.</li>
